export const objective = `Do you feel that you already know all possible frameworks of 
business problem solving (Porter’s five forces, the BCG-matrix etc.), 
yet you are still not confident in using them? Or maybe you already took a course 
on management consulting problem solving approach, but the jargon used didn’t make 
much practical sense to you (The 80/20 rule, MECE etc.)? Whether you’re a student 
studying for case interviews or a businessperson, what you might be lacking 
is a comprehensive aproach to problem solving that generates consistent results.. 
If so, this course is for you! I can guarantee you will not find another such comprehensive
introductory course on hypothesis-based problem solving – the top consulting firms’ 
technique of choice on all kinds of business consulting engagements.`;
